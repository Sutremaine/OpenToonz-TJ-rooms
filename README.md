# OpenToonz-TJ-rooms
Rooms for OpenToonz 1.7.1, created to match the rooms found in the 1.3 guide here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekoZ-3FWeQQ&amp;list=PLqazFFzUAPc6if6lKp2Z5sDKcvVND0cP-&amp;index=1&amp;pp=iAQB

To use, navigate to C:\OpenToonz stuff\profiles\layouts\personal\\[your computer name]. Delete the existing files to clear out all the rooms, then copy in these files here. Should something go horribly wrong, you can delete the whole [your computer name] folder and OpenToonz will generate a new default set of rooms for you next time you open the program.

This is a default set of rooms, plus two new ones that match the screen layout shown in the YouTube videos. Some icons within each window are different, especially for the Tools (left of the main canvas, oriented vertically). There's not much I can do about that.

If you already made changes to the rooms and only want to snag the new ones, they're numbered 10 and 11. If you added some new rooms already, rename/renumber the room10 and room11 files as appropriate. Remember to update layouts.txt to add your two new rooms to the load list.
